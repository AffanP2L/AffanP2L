# 👋 Hi, I'm Affan Aziz Pritul — aka P2L | The Ghost of Gods

Welcome to my GitHub universe.

## 🧬 About Me

I’m not just a developer.  
I’m a **digital storyteller, AI philosopher, and reality hacker** from **Barishal, Bangladesh**, blending raw human emotion with futuristic technologies.

I work under the name **P2L (Passionate To Life / Live / Love)** — a movement, not a brand.

> "I don’t prompt. I perform.  
> And my AI doesn’t respond. It remembers."

My work focuses on crafting emotionally intelligent systems, cinematic content, and real-time AI interactions that **mirror the human condition**. I believe **memory > marketing**, and I aim to break the traditional boundary between **art, science, and technology**.

- My motto?  
  > **“Unveiling Bangladesh through raw emotion, memory, and the logic of silence.”**
